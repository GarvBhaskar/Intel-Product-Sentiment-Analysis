# Intel Products Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

Our primary objective was to build a web scraper to fetch Amazon product reviews for Intel processors. The overall project involves scraping live review data, pre-processing and exploring this data, and applying various machine learning techniques to perform sentiment analysis and get insights on the performance of Intel processors.

## Proposed Solution

Our solution integrates TF-IDF vectorization with Logistic Regression for baseline performance evaluation, leveraging Word2Vec embeddings initialized within an LSTM architecture for enhanced semantic understanding. We use NLTK for tokenization and cleaning, and TF-IDF for feature extraction. Logistic Regression is fine-tuned via GridSearchCV, and an LSTM model is trained in Keras with pretrained Word2Vec embeddings. Evaluation metrics include accuracy and visualizations like word clouds.

## Data Sources Used
Real-time reviews were collected from various e-commerce websites and social media platforms using web scraping tools like BeautifulSoup and Scrapy.

## LSTM with Word2Vec Embedding
1. Load pretrained word embedding model.
2. Construct embedding layer using embedding matrix as weights.
3. Train an LSTM with Word2Vec embedding (embedding layer => LSTM layer => dense layer).
4. Compile and fit the model using log loss function and ADAM optimizer.
